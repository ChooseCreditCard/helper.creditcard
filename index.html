          From simple checklists to AI-powered assistants, there are more tools than ever that claim to “help” you pick the right credit card. This page explains what these helpers actually do – and what still depends on your own judgment.

    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Credit Card “Helper”?</h2>
      <p>
        A credit card “helper” can be many things: a comparison website, a budgeting app, an in-app notification,
        a browser extension or an AI chatbot that explains terms and conditions in simpler language. All of them aim
        to reduce friction when you are trying to understand fees, rewards, protections or eligibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Helpers can be useful for organising information and reminding you of key details, but they do not carry
        the responsibility for your decisions. The card contract is always between you and the issuer – the helper
        is just a layer on top of that.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Types of helpers -->
    <section id="types" class="section">
      <h2>Common Types of Credit Card Helpers</h2>
      <p>Most helper tools fall into one or more of these categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Educational guides and checklists:</strong> articles, FAQs and structured guides that explain
          concepts like APR, FX fees, travel insurance or credit scores in plain language.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Comparison tables and filters:</strong> interfaces where you can sort and filter cards by
          fees, rewards, lounges, technology features or eligibility criteria.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Budgeting and tracking apps:</strong> tools that categorise your spending, highlight fees and
          show how much value you are actually getting from a card over time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI or chat-based assistants:</strong> systems that summarise documentation, answer questions
          about terminology and help you compare structured data – without giving personal financial advice.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The best helpers are transparent about their limitations and about how they make money, especially if
        they use affiliate links or sponsored placements.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Limits & risks -->
    <section id="limits" class="section">
      <h2>What Helpers Can’t Do For You</h2>
      <p>
        Even the most advanced digital helper cannot see your full financial situation, risk tolerance or
        long-term plans. That means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They cannot guarantee that a specific card is “best” for you – only highlight features and trade-offs.
        </li>
        <li>
          They may not reflect the very latest changes in fees, benefits or eligibility unless updated frequently.
        </li>
        <li>
          They cannot replace official documentation from the issuer, or local regulations in your country.
        </li>
        <li>
          AI-based helpers can misunderstand questions or summarise documents imperfectly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Treat helpers as navigation aids, not as sign-off. Important decisions – including whether to apply, how
        much to spend and how to manage debt – remain your responsibility.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Using helpers well -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How to Use Helpers in a Smart Way</h2>
      <p>
        To get value from credit-card helpers without outsourcing your judgment completely, you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use guides to learn the terminology before you look at specific cards.</li>
        <li>Use comparison tables to narrow down a long list to a small short-list.</li>
        <li>Use budgeting apps to track whether a card really delivers the value you expected.</li>
        <li>Use AI or chat assistants to clarify confusing wording – then verify key points in the official PDFs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This combination lets you move faster and avoid common misunderstandings while staying in control of
        the final decision.
